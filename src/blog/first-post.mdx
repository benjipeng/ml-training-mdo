# Welcome to the First Post!

This is the content of the first blog post. It uses **Markdown** and will eventually be rendered nicely.

Here is a simple code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

We can also have lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
