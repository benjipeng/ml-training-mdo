# Training LLMs with NVIDIA Megatron
> Training Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires specialized frameworks that can efficiently utilize distributed computing resources. NVIDIA's Megatron framework has become one of the leading solutions for training massive transformer models. This guide provides an in-depth walkthrough of using Megatron to train an LLM from scratch, covering everything from setup to advanced optimization techniques.

## The Megatron Framework

Megatron consists of two main components:
