# Styling with Tailwind CSS

**Published on April 10, 2024**

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how developers approach styling in web applications. Instead of writing custom CSS, you can rapidly build modern designs directly in your markup using utility classes.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind provides a utility-first approach that offers several advantages:

- üöÄ **Rapid development** - Build UIs quickly without context switching between files
- üîÑ **Consistent design** - Work within the constraints of a well-defined design system
- üì± **Responsive by default** - Built-in responsive modifiers make responsive design easy
- üõ†Ô∏è **Highly customizable** - Extend and configure to match your design needs
- üß© **Component extraction** - Create reusable patterns with utilities

## Getting Started with Tailwind

Installing Tailwind in a Vite project is straightforward:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

For Tailwind v4 (the latest version), your CSS becomes even simpler:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Utility-First Approach

The core concept of Tailwind is using small utility classes to build complex designs:

```jsx
<div className="flex items-center p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg space-x-4">
  <div className="shrink-0">
    <img className="h-12 w-12" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="Logo" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-black">Tailwind CSS</h4>
    <p className="text-slate-500">Utility-first CSS framework</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Responsive Design with Tailwind

Tailwind makes responsive design straightforward with intuitive breakpoint prefixes:

```jsx
<div className="text-center sm:text-left md:text-right lg:text-justify">
  This text changes alignment at different screen sizes!
</div>
```

Common breakpoints include:
- `sm:` - 640px and above
- `md:` - 768px and above
- `lg:` - 1024px and above
- `xl:` - 1280px and above
- `2xl:` - 1536px and above

## Dark Mode

Tailwind v4 makes dark mode implementation incredibly simple:

```jsx
<div className="bg-white text-black dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
  This element adapts to light/dark mode
</div>
```

## Extracting Components

While utility classes are powerful, you can extract common patterns:

```jsx
// Button.jsx
export function Button({ children, variant = "primary" }) {
  const baseStyles = "px-4 py-2 rounded font-medium focus:outline-none focus:ring-2";
  
  const variants = {
    primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white hover:bg-blue-600 focus:ring-blue-300",
    secondary: "bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300 focus:ring-gray-200",
    danger: "bg-red-500 text-white hover:bg-red-600 focus:ring-red-300"
  };
  
  return (
    <button className={`${baseStyles} ${variants[variant]}`}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS has become a staple in modern web development for good reason. Its utility-first approach enables rapid development while maintaining a consistent design system. With Tailwind v4's improvements, styling applications has never been more efficient.
